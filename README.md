# yaPs

yaPs is a peer-to-peer (and hopefully some day peer-to-server) chat client based in a linux terminal.

### Installation

1. `git clone git@github.com:ruuffian/yaPs.git` will clone the source code.

2. `make` will build the project binaries.

3. `./bin/server` to run the server, `./bin/client` to run the client. Atm, very simple.


### License

It's an MIT License, go crazy. Open source is good.
